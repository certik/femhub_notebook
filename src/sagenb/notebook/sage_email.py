Send an Email

Sage supports very easily sending an email from Sage to notify
yourself when some event occurs.  This does not require configuring an
email server or anything else, since Sage already includes by default
a sophisticated email server (which is part of Twisted).

EXAMPLES::

    sage: email('xxxsageuser@gmail.com', 'The calculation finished!')  # not tested
    Child process ... is sending email to xxxsageuser@gmail.com
