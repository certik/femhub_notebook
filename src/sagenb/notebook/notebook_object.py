Start the Sage Notebook server. More documentation is available in the
Sage installation guide, in the "Running the Sage Notebook Securely"
chapter, and at http://wiki.sagemath.org/StartingTheNotebook.

    INPUT:
        directory     -- directory that contains the Sage notebook files;
                         the default is .sage/sage_notebook, in your home
                         directory.
        port          -- (default: 8000), port to serve the notebook on.
        address       -- (default: 'localhost'), address of network
                         interface to listen on; give '' to listen on all
                         interfaces.
        port_tries    -- (default: 0), number of additional ports to try if
                         the first one doesn't work (*not* implemented).
        secure        -- (default: False) if True use https so all
                         communication, e.g., logins and passwords, between
                         web browsers and the Sage notebook is encrypted
                         via GNU TLS.  *Highly recommended!*
        require_login -- (default: True) if True login is required else web
                         user is automatically logged in as user admin.
        reset         -- (default: False) if True allows you to set the
                         admin password.  Use this if you forget your admin
                         password.
        accounts      -- (default: False) if True, any visitor to the
                         website will be able to create a new account.  If
                         False, only the admin can create accounts
                         (currently, this can only be done by running with
                         accounts=True for a few minutes, or on the command
                         line with, e.g., 
                             nb = load('./sage/sage_notebook/nb.sobj')
                             nb.set_accounts(True)
                             nb.add_user("username", "password",
                                 "email@place", "user")
                             nb.save()
        open_viewer   -- (default: True) whether to pop up a web browser.
                         You can override the default browser by setting the
                         SAGE_BROWSER environment variable, e.g., by putting
                             export SAGE_BROWSER="firefox"
                         in the file .bashrc in your home directory.
        timeout       -- (default: 0) seconds until idle worksheet
                         sessions automatically timeout, i.e., the
                         corresponding Sage session terminates. 0 means
                         `never timeout'. If your server is running out
                         of memory, setting a timeout can be useful as
                         this will free the memory used by idle
                         sessions.
        server_pool   -- (default: None) list; this option specifies that
                         worksheet processes run as a separate user (chosen
                         from the list in the server_pool -- see below). 
                      
    \begin{verbatim}

    NOTE: If you have problems with the server certificate hostname not
    matching, do \code{notebook.setup()}.
    
    EXAMPLES:

    1. I just want to run the Sage notebook.  Type

           notebook()

    2. I want to run the Sage notebook server on a remote machine and be the
       only person allowed to log in.  Type

           notebook(address='', secure=True)

       the first time you do this you'll be prompted to set an administrator
       password.  Use this to login. NOTE: You may have to run
       notebook.setup() again and change the hostname.

    3. I just want to run the server locally on my laptop and do not want to
       be bothered with having to log in:
 
           notebook(require_login=False)

       Use this ONLY if you are *absolutely certain* that you are the only
       user logged into the laptop and do not have to worry about somebody
       else using the Sage notebook on localhost and deleting your files.

    4. I want to create a Sage notebook server that is open to anybody in
       the world to create new accounts. To run the Sage notebook publicly
       (1) at a minimum run it from a chroot jail or inside a virtual
       machine (see wiki.sagemath.org/StartingTheNotebook and the Sage
       install guide) and (2) use a command like
    
           notebook(address='', server_pool=['sage1@localhost'],
           ulimit='-v 500000', accounts=True)

       The server_pool option specifies that worksheet processes run as a
       separate user.  The ulimit option restricts the memory available to
       each worksheet processes to 500MB.  See help on the `accounts' option
       above.

       Be sure to make that the sage_notebook/nb.sobj and contents of
       sage_notebook/backups is chmod og-rwx, i.e., only readable by the
       notebook process, since otherwise any user can read nb.sobj, which
       contains user email addresses and account information (password are
       stored hashed, so fewer worries there). You will need to use the
       `directory' option to accomplish this.


    INPUT:  (more advanced)

    More details about using these options can be found at:
    http://wiki.sagemath.org/StartingTheNotebook and in the Sage install
    guide.

    NOTE: The values of these two properties default to what they were last
    time the notebook command was called.

        server_pool -- (initial default: None), if given, should be a list
                       like ['sage1@localhost', 'sage2@localhost'], where
                       you have setup ssh keys so that typing
                           ssh sage1@localhost
                       logs in without requiring a password, e.g., by typing
                       `ssh-keygen' as the notebook server user, then
                       putting ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub as the file
                       .ssh/authorized_keys. Note: you have to get the
                       permissions of files and directories just right --
                       see the above wiki page for more details.

        ulimit      -- (initial default: None -- leave as is), if given and
                       server_pool is also given, the worksheet processes
                       are run with these constraints. See the ulimit
                       documentation. Common options include:
                           -t   The maximum amount of cpu time in seconds.
                                NOTE: For Sage, -t is the wall time, not cpu time.
                           -u   The maximum number of processes available to
                                a single user. 
                           -v   The maximum amount of virtual memory
                                available to the process.
                       Values are in 1024-byte increments, except for `-t',
                       which is in seconds, and `-u' which is a positive
                       integer. Example:  ulimit="-v 400000 -t 30"
