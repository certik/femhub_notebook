Sage Interface to the HG/Mercurial Revision Control System

These functions make setup and use of source control with Sage
easier, using the distributed Mercurial HG source control system.
To learn about Mercurial, see
http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/ , in particular
UnderstandingMercurial .

This system should all be fully usable from the Sage notebook
(except for merging, currently). This system should all be mostly
usable from the Sage notebook.


-  Use ``hg_sage.record()`` to record all of your
   changes.

-  Use ``hg_sage.bundle('filename')`` to bundle them
   up to send them.

-  Use ``hg_sage.inspect('filename.hg')`` to inspect a
   bundle.

-  Use ``hg_sage.unbundle('filename.hg')`` to import a
   bundle into your repository.

-  Use ``hg_sage.pull()`` to synchronize with the
   latest official stable Sage changesets.

This is an HG (Mercurial) repository.

To learn about Mercurial, see http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/.

This system should all be fully usable from the Sage notebook.

Most commands are directly provided as member functions.  However,
you can use the full functionality of hg, i.e.,

``hg_%(obj_name)s("command line arguments")``

is *exactly* the same as typing::
