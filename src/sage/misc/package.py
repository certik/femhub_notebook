Sage package management commands

A Sage package has the extension .spkg. It is a tarball that is
(usually) bzip2 compressed that contains arbitrary data and an
spkg-install file. An Sage package typically has the following
components:


-  spkg-install - shell script that is run to install the package

-  Sage.txt - file that describes how the package was made, who
   maintains it, etc.

-  sage - directory with extra patched version of files that needed
   during the install


Use the ``install_package`` command to install a new
package, and use ``optional_packages`` to list all
optional packages available on the central Sage server. The
``upgrade`` command upgrades all *standard* packages -
there is no auto-upgrade command for optional packages.

All package management can also be done via the Sage command line.
